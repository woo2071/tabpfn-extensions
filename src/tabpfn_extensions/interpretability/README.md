# TabPFN Interpretability

## TabPFN shapiq

``shapiq`` is a library for computing Shapley-based explanations like Shapley values or Shapley
interactions for machine learning models. The library is a redesigned and improved version of
the well-known SHAP library that provides a more efficient and scalable implementation of Shapley
values and Shapley interactions. In addition, ``shapiq`` offers native support for interpreting
TabPFN by utilizing a remove-and-recontextualize paradigm of model interpretation tailored towards
in-context models. The ``shapiq`` library and the paper introducing the improved Shapley value
computation for TabPFN can be cited as follows:

## TabPFN SHAP

``shap`` is a library for computing Shapley values explanations for machine learning models.
``shap`` constructs these explanations by imputing missing values with randomly drawn samples from
a background distribution. The ``shap`` library can be cited as follows:
